# BallBeam_PID
Documentation and Application for a PID controlled Ball-and-beam style plant

Reference Materials:
  -  PID control theory from CalTech https://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am06-pid_16Sep06.pdf
  -  Ball and Beam system model from uMichigan 
  -  Stepper Motor https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/download/1141537/STEPPERONLINE/17HS08-1004S.html

# Mechanical Design Considerations
In uMichigan's Ball and Beam model there is this assumption that the relationship between $/alpha$ and $/theta$ is approximately linearized by $d/L$
